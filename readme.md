# Personal Bibliography for Websites

This contains my personal bibliography and a script to generate an
HTML file for various websites. Run the Python script to make HTML and
PDF versions of the bibliography.

   python make-publications-markdown.py

## TODO:

- Figure out a way to output a Markdown version of the bibliography
  (pandoc just outputs an MD file with links to the bibliography, not
  a standalone document).
- Figure out how to make the paper title a link to the URL in each
  entry.
- Figure out how to generate a version that includes the abstract of
  each paper.
- Figure out how to generate a version that has the HTML body but no
  header.

## Page description for website:

A listing of Charles Martin's academic publications about percussion,
computer music, and human computer interaction.
