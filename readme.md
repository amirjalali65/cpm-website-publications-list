# Personal Bibliography for Websites

This contains my personal bibliography and a script to generate an
HTML file for various websites. Run the Python script to make HTML and
PDF versions of the bibliography.

   python make-publications-markdown.py

## TODO:

- Figure out a way to output a Markdown version of the bibliography
  (pandoc just outputs an MD file with links to the bibliography, not
  a standalone document).
