  Abstract =     {This thesis seeks to articulate a performer's
                  perspective of the interactions between percussion
                  and computer in performance. A selection of
                  compositions for percussion and computer will be
                  used to explain how understanding the role of the
                  computer can inform the player's technical and
                  musical choices and is vital to convey a cohesive
                  performance. Two of the compositions are the
                  author's own work. Discussion of both the creation
                  and performance of these works will suggest how
                  using the computer with percussion extends the
                  musical possibilities in a solo performance and
                  allows implicit connections with practitioners of
                  other art-forms.},

                  The concept of Strike on Stage is to integrate

                  percussion performance. A large projection surface
                  is positioned directly behind the performers, while
                  a computer vision system tracks their movements. The
                  setup allows computer visualisation and sonification
                  to be directly responsive and unified with the
                  performersâ€™ gestures.},

  Abstract =     {This thesis traces the development of a number of
                  mobile computer music systems and their use in
                  ensemble percussion performances. The research is
                  motivated by the challenges of working with laptop
                  based computer music systems in ensemble situations.
                  The aims were to develop elegant, portable, and
                  flexible computer music tools, to make these tools
                  accessible to other percussionists, and to discover
                  the opportunities that they enable in performance
                  practice. These aims have been explored through
                  three musical projects for percussion and Apple's
                  iOS devices: Nordlig Vinter, a suite of duo
                  compositions; and two collaborative works, 3p3p and
                  Snow Music developed together with two other
                  percussionists. Articulated from a performer's
                  perspective, this artistic research examines a
                  number of software frameworks for developing mobile
                  computer music applications. The development,
                  rehearsal process and performances of the musical
                  projects have been documented with video and audio
                  recordings. An ethnographic investigation of this
                  data has given insight into the limitations and
                  affordances of mobile computer music devices in a
                  variety of performance contexts. All of the projects
                  implemented elegant computer music setups and the
                  limited visual interfaces of the mobile devices
                  demanded simple but clear interface design. In Snow
                  Music in particular, "percussive" interaction with
                  the mobile devices along with an improvised
                  performance practice contributed to a collaborative
                  development cycle. This process revealed some of the
                  limits of expression with the computer sounds used
                  and led to a very successful series of performance
                  outcomes.},

                  project began with a system that brought computer
                  elements to NordligVinter, a suite of percussion
                  duos, using an iPhone, RjDj, Pure Data and
                  ahome-made pickup system. This process was

                  proved to be elegant and convenient inperformance
                  situations with very little time and space to set
                  up, as well as inperformance classes and workshops.

                  designed to integrate mobile computer instruments
                  into a percussion ensemble performance practice. The
                  works were motivated by the author's desire to
                  introduce computer music elements to non-programmer
                  members of the percussion group Ensemble Evolution.
                  Each of the works used simple setups with Apple iOS
                  devices in order to facilitate rehearsals and
                  increase the performers' engagement with the
                  computer elements of the works. This artistic
                  research considers the performance practices that
                  are enabled and demanded when complementing acoustic
                  percussion instruments with mobile music devices.
                  The first two works, 3p3p and Nordlig Vinter used
                  computer music elements composed in Pure Data
                  running on iPhones using RjDj in the context of
                  semi-composed works for percussion. The third work,
                  Snow Music was a collaboratively developed
                  improvised work using percussion and a native iOS
                  app developed with libpd. An ethnographic analysis
                  of the preparation and performance of the three
                  works shows a development in the role of mobile
                  devices in the performances and the emergence of
                  performance practices using both natural
                  interactions and control of generative processes. },

  Abstract =     {The group experience of synchronisation is a key
                  aspect of ensemble musical performance. This paper
                  presents a number of strategies for syncing
                  performance information across networked
                  iPad-instruments to enable creativity among an
                  ensemble of improvising musicians. Acoustic
                  instrumentalists sync without mechanical
                  intervention. Electronic instruments frequently
                  synchronise rhythm using MIDI or OSC connections. In
                  contrast, our system syncs other aspects of
                  performance, such as tonality, instrument functions,
                  and gesture classifications, to support and enhance
                  improvised performance. Over a number of
                  performances with an iPad and percussion group,
                  Ensemble Metatone, various syncing scenarios have
                  been explored that support, extend, and disrupt
                  ensemble creativity.},

                  a control agent returns similar messages sourced
                  from a statistical model. The three touch-screen
                  apps respond according to design paradigms of
                  reward, support, and disruption. In this study of an
                  ongoing musical practice, significant effects were
                  observed due to the apps' interfaces and how they
                  respond to agent interactions. The ``reward'' app
                  received the highest ratings. The results were used
                  to iterate the app designs for later performances.},
